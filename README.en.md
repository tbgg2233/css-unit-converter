# CSS Unit Converter

A lightweight, client-side tool that converts **CSS values** from `vw` units to fixed `px` units based on a **user-defined reference width**.
Paste your CSS, set the target screen width, click **Convert**, and receive an updated version ready to copy.

## 🚀 Features

- Fully **client-side** — no backend required.
- Converts `vw` values to `px` with a single click.
- Clean and minimal interface.
- Ideal for designers and developers needing **precise, fixed-width output**.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Enter or paste your CSS containing `vw` values.
2. Define the reference screen width in pixels.
3. Click **Convert**.
4. The tool recalculates all `vw` units into absolute `px` values.
5. Copy the generated CSS and use it wherever needed.

## ⚡ Why Use This Tool?

While `vw` units are great for **responsive layouts**, sometimes you need fixed pixel values for:

- Static layouts
- Emails or templates with strict rendering rules
- Exporting assets based on a specific screen size
- Design handoff consistency

This tool provides a simple, **browser-based solution** without requiring build tools or dependencies.
