# CSS Unit Converter

A lightweight, client-side tool that converts **CSS values** from `vw` units to fixed `px` units based on a **user-defined reference width**.  
Paste your CSS, set the target screen width, click **Convert**, and receive an updated version ready to copy.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Enter or paste your CSS containing `vw` values.

5. Copy the generated CSS and use it wherever needed.

## ⚡ Why Use This Tool?

While `vw` units are great for **responsive layouts**, sometimes you need fixed pixel values for:  

- Static layouts  
- Emails or templates with strict rendering rules  
- Exporting assets based on a specific screen size  
- Design handoff consistency  

This tool provides a simple, **browser-based solution** without requiring build tools or dependencies.
