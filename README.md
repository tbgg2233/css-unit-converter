# CSS VW-to-PX Converter

A lightweight, client-side tool that converts CSS values from `vw` units to fixed `px` units based on a user-defined reference width.  
Paste your CSS, set the target screen width, click **Convert**, and receive an updated version ready to copy.

## Features
- Fully client-side (no backend required)
- Converts `vw` values to `px` with a single click
- Clean and minimal interface
- Ideal for designers and developers needing precise, fixed-width output

## How It Works
1. Enter or paste your CSS containing `vw` values.
2. Define the reference screen width in pixels.
3. Click **Convert**.
4. The tool recalculates all `vw` units into absolute `px` values.
5. Copy the generated CSS and use it wherever needed.

## Why Use This Tool?
While `vw` units are great for responsive layouts, sometimes you need fixed pixel values for:
- Static layouts
- Emails or templates with strict rendering rules
- Exporting assets based on a specific screen size
- Design handoff consistency

This tool provides a simple, browser-based solution without requiring build tools or dependencies.
